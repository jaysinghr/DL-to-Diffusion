# Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion

This repository chronicles my learning journey through Jeremy Howard's comprehensive course, ['Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion'](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html). It contains a collection of notebooks, exercises, and projects derived from the course material, showcasing my progression from foundational concepts to achieving stable diffusion in deep learning.

## Key Highlights
- **Coursework:** Notebooks covering various topics, exercises, and hands-on implementations learned from Jeremy Howard's course.
- **MinimalAI Framework:** Building a custom deep learning framework, 'MinimalAI', entirely from scratch as part of the learning process with some improvements.

The aim is to comprehensively document my learning path, from grasping the core principles of deep learning to crafting a custom framework, serving as a valuable resource for both personal review and community learning.
